Stanford,Design of Experiments,"Correlation is not causality. You've probably heard that before in any number of regression classes. If you want to infer causality from data, then the best way is to use randomized experiments. Maybe it is the only way to be sure. This course anchors experimental design within causal inference. After a few lectures you will see that it is different from most causal inferences courses. This one is about what to do when you can randomize. Most causal inference courses emphasize what to do with observational data where you could not randomize though they will also mention randomization too. In experimental design we look at how to choose the data that we will gather. In addition to being able to make causal conclusions, we also look at how to maximize the statistical efficiency of the generated data set.Experimental design as a subject is about 100 years old. The methods in this course date back to agricultural field trials. Since then the ideas have seen use in medicine, manufacturing, quality control, computer aided design and electronic commerce. Each new field takes the previous methods and then starts adapting them. Possibly the first clinical trial was that of James Lind in 1747 showing that citrus is effective against scurvy.

CME307MS&E311 can be viewed as a continuation course of MS&E211. Although there are some minor overlaps with MS&E 211, CME307/MS&E311 covers more advanced application models, in-depth optimization theories, and state of the art algorithms which were not able to be covered by MS&E211. CME307/MS&E311 also extensively covers Nonlinear and Nonconvex Optimization/Game problems, complementing to MS&E310 (Linear Optimization) and other ""Convex Optimization"" courses. The field of optimization is concerned with the study of maximization and minimization of mathematical functions. Very often the arguments of (i.e., variables in) these functions are subject to side conditions or constraints. By virtue of its great utility in such diverse areas as applied science, engineering, economics, finance, medicine, data analysis, machine learning and statistics, optimization holds an important place in both the practical world and the scientific world. Indeed, as far back as the Eighteenth Century, the famous Swiss mathematician and physicist Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) proclaimed that ... nothing at all takes place in the Universe in which some rule of maximum or minimum does not appear. The subject is so pervasive that we even find some optimization terms in our everyday language. Optimization often goes by the name Mathematical Programming (MP). The latter name tends to be used in conjunction with finite-dimensional optimization problems, which in fact are what we shall be studying here. The word ""Programming"" should not be confused with computer programming which in fact it antedates. As originally used, the term refers to the timing and magnitude of actions to be carried out so as to achieve a goal in the best possible way","Applications, theories, and algorithms for finite-dimensional linear and nonlinear optimization problems with continuous variables.

Harvard,Data Systems,"We are in the big data era. Every two days we create as much data as much we created from the dawn of humanity up to 2003 [Eric Schmidt, Google]. We are going through major transformations in businesses, sciences, as well as everyday life - collecting and analyzing data, applying machine learning across diverse scenarios, and constructing large and complex data science pipelines change everything; the key common ingredient in all those cases is storing and accessing large amounts of data. In fact, this is typically the bottleneck in any complex data-driven process/ program because the way hardware has evolved, moving data is way more expensive than doing any kind of computation. Data systems provide the means to store and analyze a massive amount of data and thus they sit in the critical path of everything we do. A data system is effectively a large collection of data structures and algorithms that work in synchrony to solve complex data access requests. It is a $100B industry, growing 10% every year [Economist, ""Data, data everywhere""]. This course is a comprehensive introduction to modern data systems. The primary focus is on trends that are shaping the data management industry right now: column-store and hybrid storage systems, NoSQL key-value stores, shared nothing architectures, cache conscious algorithms, hardware/software co-design, main-memory systems, adaptive indexing, stream processing, and scientific data management. We also study the history of data systems, traditional and seminal concepts and ideas such as the relational model, row-store database systems, optimization, indexing, concurrency control, recovery and SQL. In this way, we discuss both how and why data systems evolved over the years, as well as how these concepts apply today and how data systems might evolve in the future.

In particular we will focus on the trade-offs between the model structure of different frameworks and the algorithmic constraints that this structure implies. Central topics in search will include classical search algorithms, heuristics and relaxation, and adversarial game-playing. The representation section will cover constraint-satisfaction, logical formalisms for representing knowledge, efficient algorithms for logical inference, and an introduction to planning. The sec- tion on uncertainty will introduce probabilistic reasoning, the formalism of Markov decision pro- cesses, and conclude with an overview of Bayesian networks for modeling uncertainty. Within each area, the course will also present practical AI algorithms being used behind the scenes every day and explore cutting edge research and philosophical foundations. The class will include lectures connecting the models we explore with application in natural language process- ing, vision, machine learning, and robotics. In addition to introducing algorithms that every computer scientist should know, the course will provide a good foundation for topics covered in advanced AI courses (CS28x). CS 182 com- plements CS 181, which emphasizes machine learning. Students who take both CS 182 and CS 181, will have the background for understanding current artificial intelligence research and experience implementing algorithms and developing domain models in all key areas of the field. Finally, in spite of its practical usefulness this course is also quite fun. AI also has a long history of research into topics like puzzle-solving, game-playing, and conversational chat-bots. In this spirit, assignments will include programming an efficient Sudoku solver, an clever maze-solving robot, and a ghost avoiding agent for Pac-Man. There will also be much XKCD.
","Students completing this course will have an in-depth understanding of three core areas of AI and the connections among them, and with such other key AI areas as machine learn- ing, robotics, natural language processing and multi-agent systems. They should be able to: choose the appropriate representation for an AI problem or domain model, and construct domain models in that representation choose the appropriate algorithm for reasoning within an AI problem domain implement and debug core AI algorithms in a clean and structured manner design and analyze the performance of an AI system or component describe AI algorithms and representations and explain their performance, in writing and orally critically read papers on AI systems",0
