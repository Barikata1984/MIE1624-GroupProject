Particularly large-scale property management. When it comes to balancing working with vendors, managing contracts, taking bids for work, scoping & scheduling the work, and making sure the property is kept in tip-top shape, it often takes multiple people in full-time roles. And most of it shockingly hasn’t evolved beyond being managed with 90’s era technology. Email, excel, and pen-and-paper is where the industry is stuck. If you’ve ever worked in an office building or lived in an apartment high rise that had janky elevators, wasn’t quite the cleanest, or just didn’t quite seem like it was on top of general maintenance, they probably needed VendorPM’s help. This isn’t a small problem, either. We estimate that this is a $400B+ market that we can really make a difference in.That’s why we raised three rounds of funding from tier 1 VCs - to build a platform that makes general maintenance easier, and help give property managers visibility into areas that might be falling through the cracks. We’re passionate about bringing this to the world, and we want you along on this journey.Grow with usOpportunities for growth here are numerous, but to name a few for this role:Exposure to business operations within a rapidly growing startup: you will have an opportunity to meet and collaborate with department leaders across the businessHigh growth - we achieved 10x growth in Q1 and are determined to triple our success by year endOpportunity to grow and expand within VendorPM. You will wear many hats, be a crucial part of company growth, opportunities to own projects from start to finish, have access to mentorship, and take on new initiativesHybrid work model - we have recently acquired a beautiful office space downtown for those who are looking for nice scenery but will continue flexibility for working at home. Ideally, items are meeting in person once a weekWe have a leadership team that is committed to building the best place for top talent to work and take an invested interested in the success of our team membersWhat you will do:Assist in creating reports on Salesforce to provide insights on the performance of the teamStrengthening data integrity by cleaning, auditing, and creating new variables to better analyze dataAnalyze customer related data to provide meaningful insights, ie: Vendor Cohort AnalysisResearching sales/ops/finance strategy related initiatives, ie: Tax implications when entering a new market.Support strategic projects, ie: Chicago expansion data tracking and analysis, sales rep performance analysisCollaborate across departments to create projection models related to day to day operations.ie: Burn Rate Projection given number of new hires.Assist in creating Slide Decks for Clients and Internal Stakeholders.Our Ideal Candidate:Because we’re small, we’re looking for independent thinkers and people who like to tackle ever-evolving problems.

It provides numerous features for ISPs such as billing, ticketing, network monitoring, inventory management, scheduling, service provisioning, and more.We are looking for an enthusiastic and professional Business Analyst to add to the team, and here's what's cool about the job:Fully remote - we don't have an office anywhere!Flexible working hoursConstant challenges - we've already done all the boring stuff, so it's mostly helping build interesting new features or working on improving the existing user experience.Great team/culture - 40 hour weeks are what we do, we aggressively work to maintain a good, healthy culture, and we really care about our employees. Full benefits are provided, along with a stipend for home office equipment that you can spend on almost anything you want. We have a book-sharing club, we pay for conferences, and it's just generally a chill, fun place to work.We are engaged in all kinds of great outside projects - for example, we're a partner in Microsoft Airband, which is bringing Internet access to millions of unserved people around the world.Here's what we need:We are looking for someone to help us to define the future of Sonar. Starting by working with the product feedback we receive from our users and staff; you will help us to ensure new wants and needs are clearly defined and accurately classified.

You will also interface with our QA department, contributing test cases that will be used to measure the efficacy of the new features & functionality.You will need to work with customers to understand the problem statement, not necessarily implement what they're asking for - why do they need that field or button, and is there a better way to solve the problem? It will be important to synthesize the information you gather across a broad customer base and to be able to understand the potential impacts of proposed changes on different types of customers and their processes. As the changes roll out, you will act as an interface between development and the rest of the organization for questions and information on the new functionality.Someone who is extremely self-motivated. We tend to err on the side of leaving people alone to get work done, and since we're fully remote, that means you need to be really motivated and capable of working by yourself.

Preference will be given to those with expertise in the following specializations: cloud, SaaS, billing, telecommunications.The successful candidate will have sophisticated written and verbal communication skills, knowing how to employ the right communication strategy to best appeal to your target audience.
