Particularly large-scale property management. When it comes to balancing working with vendors, managing contracts, taking bids for work, scoping & scheduling the work, and making sure the property is kept in tip-top shape, it often takes multiple people in full-time roles. And most of it shockingly hasn’t evolved beyond being managed with 90’s era technology. Email, excel, and pen-and-paper is where the industry is stuck. If you’ve ever worked in an office building or lived in an apartment high rise that had janky elevators, wasn’t quite the cleanest, or just didn’t quite seem like it was on top of general maintenance, they probably needed VendorPM’s help. This isn’t a small problem, either. We estimate that this is a $400B+ market that we can really make a difference in.That’s why we raised three rounds of funding from tier 1 VCs - to build a platform that makes general maintenance easier, and help give property managers visibility into areas that might be falling through the cracks.
